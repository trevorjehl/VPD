# Low-Cost Open Source Vapor Phase Decomposition Scanner

This purpose of this project is to create a low-cost vapor phase decomposition droplet scanner for use in semiconductor research labs. Although traditional semiconductor manufactureres have access to the large, expensive VPD machines to evaluate silicon wafer contamination, these machines can be innacesible for smaller research facilities.

This project uses a modififed low-cost, open source 3D-printer as the basic platform for the scanner. A custom printehead was designed to hold a 1mL acid-resistant (polypropylene) plastic syringe. This repo contains the neccesary code to program complex scanning sequences for the scanning apparatus.
